Type Kana - A game to help you speed up reading Hiragana / Katakana
=========

This is a fork from : https://github.com/fleon/type-kana

The original hosted app is in: [Click here to play.](http://lab.fleon.org/type-kana/)

In this fork I added a feature which you can customize the numbers of Kana characters that you want to be tested with. 
The default number of characters was 100 Kana characters and cannot be change and sometimes working on 100 characters is too much for me.
