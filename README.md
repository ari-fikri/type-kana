Type Kana - A game to help you speed up reading Hiragana / Katakana
=========

Iâ€™ve been learning Japanese for the past few weeks, and while I have learned the Kana, it takes me quite a while to recollect them. So I created a little game to help me memorize it quicker.

In this game, you are given to read 100 random Hiragana / Katakana characters, and you type in their Romaji pronunciation. It tracks your speed (time elapsed) and accuracy.

If someone is learning Japanese, do give it a try and let me know your scores!
